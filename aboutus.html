    <h1> About TruTherapy</h1>

<p>Life is a journey, full of twist and turns, Most often a rollercoaster.

        However, it would be much easier if the enemy of our souls wasn’t our most favorite passenger,
        
        While on this ride we often become distracted by the devil and because we want answers, we look in every direction but up.
        
        Every lie he speaks easily becomes our truth.
        
        At some point our truth must meet THEE TRUTH;
        
        Drowned and choked out by the SOUND of His promises and who God says we are.</p>
        
        <p>His affirmations and validation should forever ring in our ears; meeting our hearts!
        
        And yes! It’s so very hard with our free will!
        
        But we have a beautiful example of Jesus.
        
        For every lie, there is the TRUTH Matt 4:1-11
        
        Makeup to cover up…? or Makeup to GLOW up…?
        
        Cosmetics are often used to cover up our many different imperfections. Blemishes, dark circles, and scars are things we ultimately want to conceal. And Hey! I get it!
        
        But what if we changed our perspective from concealing to revealing and enhancing the beauty that’s within…
        
        You were made in HIS image therefore nothing to hide!</p>

        <h1>About our Founder</h1>

        <img src = "images/val_aboutus.jpeg" alt="Valerie Pearson" width="170" height = "227"></a>

        <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Valerie Pearson</span> is a native of Indianapolis, IN but currently resides in Evansville, IN
        with her husband Donald Pearson and puppy Paisley Mae. She is the worship leader at
        the Rock Global Outreach Ministries at the Evansville Campus. Recording her first EP in 2016 entitled “Heavens Radio,”
        Valerie understands the power of the word of God alone, but acknowledges the universal language of music.</p>

  
        <h2>"When Life Gives You Lemons, Make Brows"</h2>

        <p>She had always enjoyed art because of its therapeutic nature, influenced by her late grandfather Robert McIntyre,
            but became interested in makeup as a way to hide behind insecurities physically, mentally, and spiritually.
            It wasn’t until God illuminating scripture and being her ultimate validation that she accepted her position 
            in the Kingdom of God as well as being created in His beautiful image, that she exchanged every lie of the enemy 
            for His Truth! </p>
